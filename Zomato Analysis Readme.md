## Description
Created a restaurant analyis of the Zomato business.

## Introduction
Analyzed the business performance of restaurants registered in the service.Performed analysis on the Food, Orders, Restaurant and Menu data sets. 

## Main Body
1)To consider the factors affecting business performance, I analyzed sales by city, rating, and cuisine. Using City as a filter and only considering ratings of 4 or higher, I observed that ratings do not actually have relevance to revenue. The highest sales are led by restaurants with no rating data.

2) The cities listed in the ratings by city, apart from Electronic City, are not sales leaders.

3)I conducted a different approach and considered cuisines. Based on the total sales amount we have filtered out the top 10 most profitable cuisines in the market. We split the visualization between Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian to see any potential fluctuations. Indian cuisine leads the market on both instances. On the slide on the right, we can observe, that overtime there are dips in the market, but Indian cuisine still leading sales, followed by Chinese.

4)Now, Top Restaurant Performers across the country are not all under Profitable Cuisines categories as the filter suggests. I’ve filtered the chart by highest revenue cities, Tirupati leads sales on all restaurants, except on Kouzina Kafe. Electronic City is the highest revenue city for Kouzina Kafe and Beverages is the cuisine with most sales for this restaurant.

Comparing Ratings once more, the only rating information on hand is for Domino's Pizza In Raipur, but it only has 129, 505 on sales. 


## Conclusion
## What restaurants bring highest revenue?
Kouzina Café
Domino’s Pizza
Hubber and Holly
Mccafe by Mc Donalds
Sweet Truth
Pizza Hut
KFC 
Baskin Robbins
These restaurants would also answer the popularity question. Since there is a lack of rating information, I can only use sales as a marker for popularity

## What cuisines bring the most sales?
Vegetarian cuisines, mainly of Indian origin are sales leaders.

## Where are these restaurants located?
The cities with the highest revenue are in the lower half of the country. Tirupati leads sales with 42,503,460 INR in sales, followed by Electronic City and Baner. More data would need to be collected to evaluate relevancy of location to sales; i.e Demographics, accessibility, tourism.

## Ideas for Further Improvement
Recommendations:
This report provides useful insights that could be used to focus advertising or promotions on the leading city markets as well as focus on vegetarian options. If the desired outcome should be to improve restaurant ratings, customer engagement when placing orders could help. Offering discounts for reviews of the restaurants in future orders could help sales and rating data at once.

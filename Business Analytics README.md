## Description
Analyzed the raw transactions log. Built cohorts, built a conversion funnel and calculated retention rates.

## Introduction
Each time a user views a product page, opens their shopping cart, or completes a purchase, the event is captured in the activity logs. The goal was to analyze how many users interact with the site and how many stay a customer overtime.

## Main Body
1)Built a conversion funnel to present the conversion rate between website view, shopping cart and purchase.

## Ideas for Further Improvement
The project did not require to provide insights on how to resolve the user loss. Considering the results, a different marketing approach can be considered. Keeping user engaged on the shopping cart process can help. Pop-ups, email reminders, discount offers before checkout. To maintain users overtime, special discounts or a loyalty program can be put in place.

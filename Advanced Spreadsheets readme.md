Estimate revenue for an investment property

## Main Body

1) Explore and filter the data- Prepare tabs for documentation, organize the spreadsheets and filter listings

4) Built a pivot table to determine which bedroom listings where more popular
5)Calculate occupancy requires the available column (which has t for True and f for False) to be converted into a numeric value. Create a new column called occupied where the values are 0 and 1, respectively, for t and f
6)Create a new pivot table using the clean calendar data. In the Values section of your pivot table, calculate the AVERAGE() of the occupied column (which has 1s and 0s). 
7)Calculate the average price and occupancy rate for a property:
Price: $300
Occupancy Rate: 80%
Annual Revenue: 365 days * $300 * 80% = $87,600
